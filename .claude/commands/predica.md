# /predica — sermon → bilingual Contentful draft + PDFs + WhatsApp (local, on-demand)

Orchestrates four `predica-*` subagents and Card C's PDF script to turn one Sunday recording into a
review-ready, bilingual website post (audio player + downloadable branded PDF per language) plus a
ready-to-paste WhatsApp message. You (the main thread) run this step by step; spawn subagents only at the
points marked **(subagent: …)**. The two **★ HUMAN GATE ★** steps stay in this conversation — never delegate
or auto-skip them. See `tasks/specs/sermon-pipeline.md` §7–§9.

## Hard rules (all steps)

- **Draft-only.** Nothing is ever published. The `predica-publisher`'s allowlist omits every `publish_*`,
  and it writes only a **DRAFT** to `production`. A human reviews and Publishes at Gate 2.
- **Send-only-by-human.** The WhatsApp message is composed, never sent.
- **Two gates are mandatory.** Gate 1 (human corrects the transcript) and Gate 2 (human reviews the draft +
  publishes) both stop and wait in this conversation.
- **Never write the `master` alias.** All Contentful writes target the `production` env as a DRAFT (server
  backstop: `PROTECTED_ENVIRONMENTS=master,production`).
- **Secret hygiene.** Never print the CMA token, Mongo URI, or any secret — reference variable names only.
  Per-sermon working files live under `tasks/predicas/<slug>/` (gitignored); temp files use `600` perms.
- **`--dry-run`** stops after the PDFs (step 4) — **no Contentful writes, no WhatsApp finalize**. It prints
  every action it would take.

## 0. Pre-flight

1. Read `.claude/config.json` → pin `config.predica` (audioInbox, artifactsDir, contentfulSpaceId,
   contentfulEnv, defaultContentfulLocale, locales, whatsappLocale, siteBaseUrl, scriptureVersion, whisper,
   audio, pdf, featured, entryBuilder, agents, gates). Resolve `MAIN_REPO_ROOT` (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).
2. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - `$1` (optional) = audio path. If omitted, pick the **newest** file in `config.predica.audioInbox`
     (`ls -t` filtered to audio extensions). Quote the path (church folders have spaces + accents).
   - `--dry-run` → boolean.
   - Resolve `sermonDate`: parse a leading `YYYYMMDD` in the filename → `YYYY-MM-DD`; else use the file's
     mtime date and note the assumption.
   - Resolve `preacher`: parse the filename (e.g. `… - Prédica - Jonathan.m4a` → `Jonathan …`); if only a
     first name, leave it for the writer/publisher to match against an existing `author` and note it.
3. **Tooling check** (Bash): `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `config.predica.whisper.bin` + `.model` all exist; and
   Chromium for the PDF (`pnpm exec playwright install chromium` if `renderPdfs` later errors with a missing
   browser). Stop with a precise message if a hard dependency is missing.
4. **Contentful env check** (skip on `--dry-run`). `mcp__contentful__list_environments(spaceId)` and confirm
   `config.predica.contentfulEnv` (`production`) exists and is accessible.
5. **Transcript reuse vs. fresh dir.** Compute `audioSha256 = shasum -a 256 "<audioPath>"` (leading hex digest).
   Scan prior runs — for each `<artifactsDir>/*/`, compare `audioSha256` to that dir's
   `links.json.sourceSha256` (else `shasum -a 256` its `source.*`).
   - **Match + a non-empty `transcript.txt`** → this exact recording was already transcribed (and corrected).
     Set `slugDir` to that dir, `reuseTranscript = true`, `audioMp3 = <slugDir>/audio.mp3` (transcode it from
     `source.*` with ffmpeg if missing), and resolve `durationSeconds` from that dir's `sermon.json` (else
     `ffprobe`). You will **skip step 1 (transcribe) and Gate 1** — tell the user you are reusing their
     corrected transcript, only regenerating the downstream content (title, summaries, scripture, PDFs,
     featured image, draft).
   - **No match** (a new recording, or a *different* file for the same Sunday → treat as fresh) →
     `reuseTranscript = false`. Derive a provisional slug from the filename (transliterate, lowercase,
     dash-collapse) and `mkdir -p <artifactsDir>/<provisional-slug>/` (temp dir; the writer's title-derived
     slug is canonical — reconcile in step 3). Run steps 1–2 normally.

## 1. Transcribe — (subagent: `config.predica.agents.transcriber`) — *skip when `reuseTranscript`*

If `reuseTranscript` (pre-flight step 5), **skip this step entirely** — the corrected transcript already
exists in `slugDir`. Otherwise dispatch `predica-transcriber` with `audioPath`, `slugDir`, and
`config.predica.{whisper,audio}`. It returns `{ durationSeconds, transcriptTxt, audioMp3, archive,
sourceSha256, … }`. Surface the transcript path and duration; keep `sourceSha256` to record in `links.json`.

## 2. ★ HUMAN GATE 1 — correct the transcript ★ — *skip when `reuseTranscript`*

If `reuseTranscript`, **skip this gate** — the human already corrected this transcript on the prior run (the
recording is byte-identical). Otherwise print the absolute path to `transcript.txt` and ask the user
**explicitly**:

> "Transcript ready at `<…>/transcript.txt` (`<mm:ss>`). Please review and correct it in place — names,
> scripture references, and any theology — then tell me to continue. I'll wait."

**Wait for the user to confirm.** Do not proceed until they do. (Never auto-skip — the transcript is the
source of truth for everything downstream.)

## 3. Write the bilingual sermon — (subagent: `config.predica.agents.writer`)

Dispatch `predica-writer` with `slugDir`, the corrected `transcript.txt`, `sermonDate`, `preacher`,
`durationSeconds`, `config.predica.scriptureVersion`, and the serviceLabel defaults. It writes `sermon.json`
and returns the **canonical** `slug`.

Then **validate + reconcile** (Bash):

- `node <config.predica.entryBuilder> <slugDir>/sermon.json` — must exit 0 (schema valid). On errors, show
  them and re-dispatch the writer to fix (max 2 attempts) before stopping.
- If the writer's canonical slug differs from the provisional dir name, rename the dir to the canonical slug
  and update `slugDir`. Re-run the PDF/publisher against the canonical paths.
- Show the user a one-glance sanity line: title (es/en), thesis, main points, key quotes, scripture refs.

## 3.5 ★ HUMAN GATE 0 — already in Contentful? (regenerate-in-place) ★

Now that the **canonical slug** exists, check whether this sermon was already published as a draft/entry —
**before** any Contentful write. Skip entirely on `--dry-run`. Reads only (`environmentId: "production"`):

1. **Look it up.** `mcp__contentful__search_entries({ content_type:"sermon", "fields.slug": finalSlug, limit:5, environmentId:"production" })`. Also catch **slug drift + earlier buggy `-N` duplicates**: search by
   `fields.sermonDate == sermonDate` and list any sermon whose slug is `finalSlug` or matches `^finalSlug-\d+$`.
2. **None found** → set `mode = "create"`, `replaceFeatured = true`; proceed to step 4. (The normal first-run path.)
3. **Found** → `get_entry` each hit to read its status (published iff `sys.publishedVersion` is set) and its
   `featuredImage` asset; build the editUrl(s). Then **stop and ask the human** (this gate stays in the
   conversation — never delegated, never auto-skipped):

   > "This sermon already exists in Contentful (`<editUrl>`, status **<draft|PUBLISHED>**[, plus N duplicates]).
   > Regenerating will **update that entry in place** (same id/URL) and replace its audio + both PDFs. Any edits
   > you made at Gate 2 — corrected text, a replaced featured photo, the publish — **will be overwritten**
   > (if it was published, you'll need to **Publish again** to push the new content live). Proceed?
   > And the **featured image**: regenerate it, or keep the one currently on the entry?"

   - **Proceed** → `mode = "update"`, `entryId = <the chosen entry>`. Set `replaceFeatured` from the answer
     (default regenerate; `false` keeps the entry's current image). If the human flags duplicates for cleanup,
     collect those `-N` entry ids to delete after the update succeeds (via `config.predica.entryDeleter`).
   - **Decline** → **stop**; make no Contentful writes. Leave all local artifacts in `slugDir`.
   - **Featured-image safety:** if the entry's current `featuredImage` is human-replaced (asset filename ≠
     `featured.png`, or the asset is published), state that explicitly in the prompt and **default to keeping
     it** (`replaceFeatured = false`) unless the human says regenerate.

## 4. Generate the branded PDFs + featured image — (Card C + featured-image scripts)

1. **PDFs.** Bash: `node <config.predica.pdf.script> <slugDir>/sermon.json` → `predica.es-AR.pdf` +
   `predica.en-US.pdf` in `slugDir`. If it fails for a missing browser, run
   `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` once and retry. Confirm both PDFs exist with non-zero size.
2. **Featured image.** Bash: `node <config.predica.featured.script> <slugDir>/sermon.json` → `featured.png`
   (1200×630) in `slugDir`. This generates an AI background (Google Gemini) themed to the sermon, with the
   branded title/date overlaid. **It degrades gracefully:** with no `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or on any API failure)
   it renders an on-brand typographic card instead — the script still exits 0 and writes `featured.png`.
   Confirm `featured.png` exists with non-zero size. (The image is a **draft default**; the human approves or
   replaces it at Gate 2.)

> **`--dry-run` stops here.** Print the dry-run summary (transcript, sermon.json, both PDFs, `featured.png`,
> the slug, and the Contentful/WhatsApp actions that WOULD run) and **end** — no Contentful writes, no
> WhatsApp finalize.

## 5. Publish the DRAFT — (subagent: `config.predica.agents.publisher`)

Dispatch `predica-publisher` with `slugDir`, `sermon.json`, the canonical `finalSlug`, the Gate-0
`mode` (`"create"` | `"update"`) and (on update) `entryId` + `replaceFeatured`, the `sourceSha256`,
`config.predica.{contentfulSpaceId,contentfulEnv,entryBuilder,assetUploader,entryCreator,entryDeleter}`, the
two `pdfPaths`, the `audioMp3` path, and the `featured.png` path. It uploads the audio + both PDFs (+ the
featured image unless the human kept theirs), **upserts** both-locale `bibleVerse` refs by their derived
version-scoped key (reused site-wide — same passage → one shared entry), links the preacher, and **creates**
the bilingual **DRAFT** `sermon` entry or **updates
the existing one in place** — returning `{ mode, updated, entryId, editUrl, finalSlug, assetIds, bibleVerseIds,
cleanedUp, published:false }`. On update it also deletes the superseded old assets and any orphaned legacy
verses (never a shared verse). There is **no slug bumping** — Gate 0 already resolved create-vs-update, so the
`finalSlug` is fixed. If Gate 0 flagged `-N` duplicates for cleanup, delete those entries now via
`node <config.predica.entryDeleter> --space <s> --env <e> --entry-id <…>` after confirming the update succeeded.

## 6. Compose the WhatsApp text — (subagent: `config.predica.agents.whatsapp`)

Dispatch `predica-whatsapp` with `slugDir`, `sermon.json`, the publisher's `finalSlug`,
`config.predica.siteBaseUrl`, and `config.predica.whatsappLocale`. It writes `whatsapp.txt` using the
deterministic canonical URL `${siteBaseUrl}/es-AR/predicas/<finalSlug>` and returns the message — **never sent**.

## 7. ★ HUMAN GATE 2 — review, promote, publish, share ★

Print a single summary block and **stop** (no further action):

- **Transcript:** `<…>/transcript.txt`
- **sermon.json:** `<…>/sermon.json`
- **PDFs:** `<…>/predica.es-AR.pdf`, `<…>/predica.en-US.pdf`
- **Contentful (production):** `<editUrl>` — **created as a draft** (first run) **or updated in place**
  (regenerate: same id/URL). If it was **already published**, the live page keeps showing the OLD content
  until you **Publish again**. (Audio + both PDFs + the featured image are attached.) If a regenerate cleaned
  up duplicates or legacy verses, that is listed below.
- **Featured image:** `<…>/featured.png` — generated as a **draft default** (review it; replace in Contentful
  with a real photo if you prefer)
- **WhatsApp (es-AR):** `<…>/whatsapp.txt` — canonical URL `<…>` (verify the production domain)

Then tell the user, verbatim intent:

> "Done — everything is a **draft**. To go live: in Contentful (production) review both locales and the
> **featured image** (replace it if you'd rather use a photo), and **Publish** (the publish webhook
> revalidates the site). Then paste the WhatsApp text. **No agent publishes or sends.**"

**Never move any Trello card to Done. Never publish. Never send.**

## Failure handling

If any subagent or script fails, stop at that step, surface the exact error (failing command + stderr / the
agent's `{ ok:false, error }`), and leave all artifacts in `slugDir` for inspection. **Re-running `/predica`
on the same audio is safe and idempotent:** pre-flight matches the recording's `sourceSha256` and reuses the
corrected transcript (skipping transcription + Gate 1); **Gate 0** detects the existing Contentful sermon by
slug and, on your approval, **updates it in place** (same id) rather than creating a `-2` duplicate, replacing
its assets and cleaning up orphaned legacy verses. Cap any auto-retry at **2 attempts** per step, then hand
back to the human.
